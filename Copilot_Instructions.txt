TONGUE-Core Development Instructions
Purpose

TONGUE-Core is the foundation of the TONGUE Engine. Its job is to provide core utilities, math, entity/component systems, resource management, and system abstractions. Everything here must remain independent of Renderer, Audio, Input, or UI modules.

Engineer Guidance
1. Scope

Only implement functionality that supports all other modules.

Do not reference graphics, audio, input, or UI.

Keep modules small and focused. Each class or utility should do one thing.

2. Code Practices

Use C++17 features where appropriate.

Prefer std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr over raw pointers.

Avoid global state; favor dependency injection.

Keep functions ≤ 40 lines; break complex logic into helpers.

Use constexpr, inline, and templates to maximize compile-time safety.

3. Naming Conventions

Classes/structs: CamelCase

Functions/variables: snake_case

Constants: ALL_CAPS

File names: match main class or module name.

4. Error Handling

Prefer return-based error handling (Result or optional) over exceptions for recoverable errors.

Log critical errors clearly.

Validate inputs on all public interfaces.

5. Documentation

Each class, struct, and public function must have a comment explaining purpose and usage.

Include example usage for complex utilities.

6. Core Modules

Math Utilities

Vectors, matrices, quaternions, transforms, constants.

No references to rendering or physics engines yet.

Entity & Component System

Lightweight IDs, component storage, queryable systems.

Fast lookups, modular design, no rendering dependencies.

Resource Management

Memory pools, object lifetimes, generic asset handling.

Thread-safe where necessary.

System Utilities

Logging, config, time, file I/O abstractions.

Must be usable by other modules without modification.

Networking (Optional)

Serialization/deserialization only.

No high-level network logic.

7. Testing

Write unit tests for every class or utility.

Place tests in a Tests/ folder.

Validate edge cases and performance-critical sections.
