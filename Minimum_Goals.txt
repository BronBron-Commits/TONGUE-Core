Minimum Goals for TONGUE-Core

Entity & Component System

Entities must support multiple character types.

Components should include move/ability definitions, stats, health, state flags.

Core should allow dynamic attachment of abilities or movesets at runtime (e.g., different characters load different movesets).

Event & Messaging System

Events must handle character-specific actions (e.g., “AttackStarted(characterID)”, “MoveExecuted(characterID)”).

Must support broadcasting to multiple systems (UI, Animation, Audio, Physics).

State & Tick Management

Core should maintain per-entity state updates each tick.

Time/delta management should support fast, predictable updates for multiple entities simultaneously.

Resource & Configuration Management

Core may need ability to reference move/ability data (could be JSON, scriptable objects, or data tables).

Must support dynamic character instantiation with different sets of components.

Interfaces for Other Systems

Must provide hooks for Renderer to know which entity needs to be drawn and in which state.

Must provide hooks for Audio (for abilities, character actions).

Must provide hooks for Input to bind player or AI controls per character.
